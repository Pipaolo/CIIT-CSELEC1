          Hawkeye's Bow and Quiver are a pair of specialized tools used by
          former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and Avenger, Hawkeye. Serving as his primary
          weapons, Hawkeye carries a unique, collapsible recurve bow along with
          a mechanized quiver that stores and deploys his trick arrows.

            An expert marksman and fighter, Clint Barton puts his talents to
            good use by working for S.H.I.E.L.D. as a special agent. The archer
            known as Hawkeye also boasts a strong moral compass that at times

              Very little is known about the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent known as Hawkeye
              or his origins. An accomplished combatant and weapons master, he
              was present for Thor’s arrival on Earth, and was impressed with
              the God of Thunder. He was also instrumental in bringing over
              Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, to the side of S.H.I.E.L.D,
              sparing her life and offering her a path to redemption. For his
              extraordinary abilities, he was recruited by Nick Fury to be part
              of the Avengers Initiative. Unfortunately, in his first mission
              with the Avengers, he initially worked against them, thanks his
              mind being controlled by Loki, the Asgardian God of Mischief.
              After being broken free, however, the horrified Clint did work
              alongside his fellow Super Heroes to bring down the trickster god.
              Since then, he has managed to put his talents to good use against
              the Chitauri, Ultron, HYDRA, and even his fellow Avengers when it
              seemed necessary.

              As one of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s best agents, the World’s greatest
              marksman, and an Avenger, Hawkeye uses traditional weapons as well
              as high-tech ones, with a strong affinity for his archery bows.
              Few humans on the planet compare to Clint Barton when it comes to
              his astonishing talents in precise marksmanship, fighting, flying,
              and tactical prowess. An expert acrobat, military-trained
              combatant, and master assassin, Barton can stand toe-to-toe with
              some of the best fighters around. He is also a master tactician
              and spy—the Avengers face quite a bit of difficulty when Hawkeye
              works for Loki and turns his plans against them. Hawkeye’s
              specialized equipment include recurve bows, compound bows, a
              specialized arrow quiver, speed loader, Busse dagger, a
              S.H.I.E.L.D.-issued handgun, and collapsible baton.

        <p class="font-dosis">
          The man who would become known as Hawkeye was born Clint Barton.
          Orphaned at an early age, he joined the circus and apprenticed himself
          to the Swordsman, a performer who specialized in tricks with blades.
          After he discovered the Swordsman stealing from the circus, the two
          fought, and Barton was left for dead. Barton recovered, and he
          continued his martial training with the circus’s resident archer,
          Trickshot. Barton excelled with the bow, and he decided to use his
          skills to embark on a career as a costumed crime fighter named
          Hawkeye. After some initial misadventures, Hawkeye proved his worth to
          the Avengers, and he was a regular member of that group’s rotating
          cast throughout the 1960s. At the end of that decade, he used a growth
          serum developed by fellow Avenger Hank Pym and became the giant-sized
          Goliath, a role he kept for the next several years. When Barton
          resumed his Hawkeye persona in the early 1970s, he found that his old
          skills as an archer had not deserted him. The ensuing decade was a
          restless one, however. It was characterized by numerous stints with
          the Avengers and other teams, and by the early 1980s, Hawkeye was a
          solo crime fighter. During this time, Barton fell in love with and
          married Barbara (“Bobbi”) Morse, who was otherwise known as the
          costumed adventurer Mockingbird. Together, the pair recruited their
          own team, the West Coast Avengers (featuring Iron Man, Tigra, and
          Wonder Man).

          fall apart, and Mockingbird was apparently killed by the evil demon
          Mephisto. The rest of the group split off to form Force Works, while
          Hawkeye, alone once more, retreated to the wilderness. Feeling the
          need for human company, he drifted back to the Avengers before
          assuming leadership of the Thunderbolts, a team that proved to be one
          of Marvel’s most enduring creations of the 1990s. Although the premise
          of villains acting on the side of the law was not wholly original—John
          Ostrander’s Suicide Squad covered that ground a decade earlier—the
          monthly Thunderbolts comic focused on themes of redemption that were
          largely absent from Ostrander’s work. After a dramatic lineup change
          in the Thunderbolts in 2003, Hawkeye returned to the Avengers, and he
          was seemingly killed while fighting the alien Kree the

          following year. In typical comic fashion, Barton was eventually
          resurrected, and he joined the New Avengers as the costumed martial
          artist Ronin. Believing Barton to be dead, Kate Bishop, a bow-wielding
          member of the Young Avengers, adopted the name Hawkeye, retaining it
          even after Barton resumed his Hawkeye identity as a member of Captain
          America’s Secret Avengers. Both Hawkeyes were featured in writer Matt
          Fraction and artist Daniel Aja’s Hawkeye, which debuted in August
          2012. The critically acclaimed book was a gritty street level tale
          about crime in the city, but it was infused with humour and
          character-driven stories that made it a novelty among monthly
          superhero titles.
